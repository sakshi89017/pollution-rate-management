# Air Quality Index Prediction Model 
## Description
This machine learning project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on concentrations of various air pollutants. The model analyzes how different pollutants affect overall air quality and provides accurate AQI predictions using a Decision Tree learning algorithm.
Later on, if hospital data is available for repository diseases led from air pollution, i will identify patterns and interesting relationships between the level of air pollution and repository diseases.

1. Country_name:  
Provides the name of the country.  
2. city_name:  
name of the city in the given country.
3.  Air Quality Index:   
Air Quality Index(AQI) is a numerical value indication how clean or polluted the air is for the given location. AQI ranges for 0 to 500. Higer AQI values indicate polluted air which is poses a significant risk to health. 

**AQI Categories:**   
| Category | Range | 
| ----- | ----- |
| Good | below 50|
| Moderate | 51 - 100 |
| Unhealthy  (sensitive groups such as children, eldery) | 101 - 150 |
| Unhealthy | 151 - 200 |
| Very UnHealthy | 201 - 300 |
| Hazardous | above 300 |
